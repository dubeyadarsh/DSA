ArrayList is dynamic size data structure. arrayList can increase or decrease its size based on the requirements. 
ArrayList also store elements in contagious block like array and unlike linkedlist.
Initial capacity of arraylist considered as 10.
when the old capacity of arraylist is full, then size of arraylist gets changed.
Size of newly created array=1.5X size of old array.

As we know arraylist stores the element in the array and when the size of array gets full then a new array of greater size is created and old array copied in this new array 
thats's how arraylist works.
