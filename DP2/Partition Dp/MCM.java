// In this type of problem
// hum har index pe partition karte hau aur left and right half me divide karke solve karte hai
// jis bhi partition per optimised answer aata hai hum wo return karte hai
// for e.g, Matrix chain multiplication me number of operation = n*m*p hota hai jahan pe n*m is size of 1st matrix and m*p is the size of 2nd matrix.

// So question me hume bunch of matrix given hai aur unko multiply karna hai in a way such that number of operation minimum ho 
// to hum chahe pehle last k 2 matrix multiply kare ya beech k 2 ya start k 2 matrix, har baar number of operation alag hoga .

// one more things multiplication of matrix is possible if and only if number of col in 1st matrix should be equal to number of row in 2nd matrix
