// In this type of problem
// hum har index pe partition karte hau aur left and right half me divide karke solve karte hai
// jis bhi partition per optimised answer aata hai hum wo return karte hai
// for e.g, Matrix chain multiplication me number of operation = n*m*p hota hai jahan pe n*m is size of 1st matrix and m*p is the size of 2nd matrix.


Rules to appraoch->
1) Start with entire block/array -> f(i,j) initially i will be at 0 and j will be at size-1
2)Try all partition 
            -> By running a loop
3) Return the best possible 2 partition.

For Matrix chain multiplication->
[10,20,30,40,50]
start from i=1, and j=4
run a loop from (k=i to j-1) and do the partition at every k .
why j-1? because we are doing partition i.e, we are making left and right and if we do partition at j i.e, end of array then there will not 
remain any right portion.
After getting answer from evry partition return minimum ans.
