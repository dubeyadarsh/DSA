                                                                               *************  Huffman Coding *********************


 1)Fixed length encoding . ----> every Character has 1 byte size and every 1 byte has 8 bit .. Now, Scenario is let's say i have to send "aaabbbcccc" only this message
                                                          it contains only 3 different character and if we use only 3 byte system then again we can send this message simply,
                                                             2^0 =1 only 1 character can be send
                                                              2^1=2 only 2 different type of character can be send using 1 bit( 1 character represent 0 and other represent 1)
                                                              2^2 =4 only 43 differet type of character can be send ... 00,01,10,11
                                                          Now in our case if we use only 2 bit system even we can send the mesage easily
                                                          So instead of using 8 bit type for every character, here we use obnly 2 bit tyoe character thar's what Fixed length  EnCoding is !!!!!!!!!!


2) Hudffman is Variable length coding that means for every character we will decide our different code based on frequency using binary tree !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    Merge those 2 node which has lesser frequency again do this till u covered every frequent element;
    Every single code wouldn't be prefix of any other code of any character.. to clear doubt u should watch Coding Ninja Video
