Considering index is starting from 1-->
left child present at -> 2*i
right child present at -> 2*i+1
parent present at -> [i/2]
leaf node will be froim {n/2}+1....n ;

 **********Morris Traversal or Threaded VBinary Tree***************
Using this traversal we can access the parent node from child node..

InOrder Morris traversal--->
         *  Right subtree ki taraf kab gya jab left exist nahi karta...
         *  Right subtree ki taraf kb jaunga jab left subtree completely traversed ho chuki ho...

Find Binary Tree from Inorder and Preorder traversal
    --> in this case first we need to build left subtree then right subtree
find binary search tree form inorder and postorder traversal
   --> in this case first we need to build right subtree then go for left subtree


To revise top and bottom view of tree .. we need to know the vertical traversal using line..
for more info open our solution on gfg for top view (In that solution we need not to use for loop in while.. i did becoz i was noob)
Basically this use concept of vertical line.....
           (Agar phir bhi na smjhe to Striver ka top view of tree ka video dekh lo)
