prime number- run for loop from 2 to squareroot to the number and then divide the number from every number bewtween for loop if it is divisible by any numbr in between then it is not prime number

if overall time is given 1 sec then only 10^7 limit tak opearation perofrm ho skte hai so if u use any algorithm wi which constrain is lesss than or equal to 10^7 then u can use o(n) algo but if if constraint is more than 10^7 then u can't apply o(n)


when u used ++i and i++ in for loop , there is nothing difference but when u do operation there will make difference
E.g =>
   a=11
   sysout(11+ (a++)) = 22
   systout(11+(++a)) == 23

Math.log(n)/Math.log(r) where r is base of log ;
