1. To caculate sum of vowels in all substring of string.. You'll need array preprocessing where at 
every index of array it stores number of substing that contains character at that particular index.

 static int vowel_calc(String s)
    {
        int n = s.length();
        int arr[] = new int[n];
 
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
 
            if (i == 0)
                // No. of occurrences of 0th character
                // in all the substrings
                arr[i] = n;
 
            else
                // No. of occurrences of ith character
                // in all the substrings
                arr[i] = (n - i) + arr[i - 1] - i;
        }
