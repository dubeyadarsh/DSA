  importatnt questionon stack

When to use monotonic stack:-
	For greater problems, use a monotonically increasing stack (from top to 		bottom).
	For smaller problems, use a monotonically decreasing stack (from top to 	bottom).
	For next problems, backwardly iterate through the list and push elements into 	the stack.
	For previous problems, forwardly iterate through the list.
	For problems with a circular list, iterate through the list twice.

   ******* One concept of using monotonic stack is " - a +"  - means pop a means answer + means add .


When to use monotonic queu?
 	Monotonic queues are very useful in problems where we want to find the 	greater/min/max till a particular window

****if there is a limit on a length and then a maximum / minimum value is required, it *****(should be a monotonic queue. If there is a feeling of seeking "nearest", it should ******be monotonous stack.*******************
