                                  You can't create array of size more than 10^8 becoz in contest we always have memory limit of 256mb
                                  You can't create array of size more than 10^6 in a function

 *********************Eulerian Circuit nd Eulerian Path *****************************
   For Undirected Graph--->
                                 if degree(no of connected edges to particular vertex ) of every vertex is even then it contains eulerian circuit
                                 if degree of all vertex is even except two vertex(i.e, if degree of aany 2 vertex is odd) then there is eulerian path
  For Directed  Graph --->
                                 if indegree == outdegree then it contains eulerian circuit
                                 if indegree==outdegree except 2 vertex then there is eulerian path
                                          ---> i) for 2 vertex
                                                       indegree=outdegree+1;
                                                       outdegree=indegree+1;
